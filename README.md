ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Braedon Watkins

I have projects to look at in portfolio if you want to get to know me more by my work.

## About Me
My passion lies mostly in programming and game development! I believe this naturally stems from a combination of interests like math and physics to animation and frontend design. <br/>

Currently working on cybersecurity and game development topics in my free time through overthewire and game jams!

## Languages
```C
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
  printf("I started coding in C!\nSomehow figured out pointers too.");
  return NULL;
}
```

```Java
import java.io.*;
public class Java
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    System.out.println("Java is my preferred language these days.");
    System.out.println("I conquered OOP with it!");
  }
}
```

```C#
using System;
using UnityEngine;
public class CSharp : MonoBehaviour
{
  void Start()
  {
    Debug.Log("C# is the language I used to learn game dev & unity!");
  }
}
```

```Python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

print("Learned AI with python! Loving the flexibility of this language!")
```
