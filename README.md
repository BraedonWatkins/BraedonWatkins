ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BraedonWatkins

I have projects to look at in portfolio if you want to get to know me more by my work.

This is just a generic readme to get to know me better. 
Maybe on a good day I'll remember this exists and update it to look cool and have some personality. In the meantime this is the gist.

I'm interested in game development primarily. I think this comes from my deep interest for math, science, but most of all games. Games I've been into since forever are DnD, LoL, any LoZ,  and the old Fire Emblem games (the newer ones are a little icky but my friends promise me three houses is good... still haven't tried it). I also like to read when I can focus on it which looks like reading one good fantasy/scifi novel and one good historical/psychological non fiction every year. 

Right now I'm learning Unity and C# to better myself as as game dev and I'm learning advanced data structures and algorithms to better myself as a programmer.
I would love to collaborate on games, robotics, or bot APIs (Alexa, Discord, etc.)
