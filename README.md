- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BraedonWatkins
I have projects to look at in portfolio if you want to get to know me more by my work.

This is just a generic readme to get to know me better. 
Maybe on a good day I'll remember this exists and update it to look cool and have some personality. In the meantime this is the gist.

I'm interested in fun coding projects. Most especially game development.
I'm learning Unity and C# to better myself as as game dev and I'm learning advanced data structures and algorithms to better myself as a programmer.
I would love to collaborate on games, robotics, or bot APIs (Alexa, Discord, etc.)

Inquiries:
