ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BraedonWatkins

I have projects to look at in portfolio if you want to get to know me more by my work.


A little about me:
I'm primarily interested in game development. This naturally stems from my interest in math, physics, but most of all games. Games I love the most are Dungeons & Dragons, Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones, and any Legend of Zelda game. I also love to read fantasy, sci-fi, and non-fiction; My current reads are The Wicked King by Holly Black, The Middle East and Islamic World by Gettleman & Schaar, and (my second read of) Dune by Frank Herbert.

Right now I'm focusing my free time to learn more about Unity, C#, and C++ to better myself as as game dev and programmer.
