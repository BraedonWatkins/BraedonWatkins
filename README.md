ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BraedonWatkins

I have projects to look at in portfolio if you want to get to know me more by my work.

This is just a generic readme to get to know me better. 
Maybe on a good day I'll remember this exists and update it to look cool and have some personality. In the meantime this is the gist.

I'm primarily interested in game development. This naturally stems from my interest in math, science, but most of all games. Games I've been into since forever are DnD, LoL, any LoZ,  and the old Fire Emblem games (still haven't tried three houses). I also like to read when I can focus on it which looks like reading one good fantasy/scifi novel and one good historical/psychological non fiction every year. 

Right now I'm learning Unity and C# to better myself as as game dev and I'm learning advanced data structures and algorithms to better myself as a programmer.
I would love to collaborate on games, robotics, or bot APIs (Alexa, Discord, etc.)
